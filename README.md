# EXT-Screen - Extented for `MMM-GoogleAssistant` v5.x

EXT-Screen is a module for the [MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) project by [Michael Teeuw](https://github.com/MichMich).

After a configurated time without any user interaction the display will turn off and hide all modules for economy mode.

You can use others EXT modules to control it:
 * with PIR Sensor (`EXT-Pir`)
 * with Touch (`EXT-ScreenTouch`)
 * with crontab (`EXT-ScreenManager`)
 * with `gateway` for full control in harmony with all EXT components.

Naturally, you can use it as a single module and without `MMM-GoogleAssistant`
